SectorMetric has asked Deloitte to advise and guide them through the market scan, evaluation and selection process for a new financial accounting system for the organisation. 

With a clear understanding of the scope and timelines (outlined above) you will need to complete an assessment of the Financial Accounting Software available.

Please provide us with a project plan that covers the following items and elaborate what each item will contain. We want to make sure that we present a strong approach to our client so that they are confident that we are able to leverage our previous experience within the technology evaluation and selection space.

Your plan should be summarised into a 2-3 slide Powerpoint deck covering the following:

Understanding of scope
Understanding of requirements
Initial draft timelines
Initial resource plan
Estimation of fees
Risks / issues / dependencies.
To help you get started, we have provided some useful information on leading market providers for Cloud Financial Close Solutions from the Gartner Magic Quadrant for financial accounting systems.
