The team is unsure of which 5 applications to select for their POC and have asked us for assistance in conducting a Cloud readiness assessment. Could you help to develop a slide with criteria that indicates whether an application would be suitable for Cloud or not? Heya has already put together a few criteria to help get you started. You can find these in the template provided.  

Once you have the criteria developed, could you apply these against the list of applications the University has provided to identify and prioritise the applications you would recommend for the POC?

Thanks again for your help.

Please present your findings on two PowerPoint slides with the following headings: 

Criteria that makes an application suitable for Cloud
Prioritised list of applications and a brief justification as to why you would prioritise these applications. 
You may wish to use the PowerPoint template provided, or get creative and make one of your own.

The following articles and websites may help you in identifying benefits, risks and considerations for moving to Cloud:
