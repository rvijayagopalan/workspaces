To help bring them along on the journey, could you help us prepare a slide to outline and justify the benefits of a transition to Cloud and provide an overview of some of the risks and considerations that the University will need to start thinking about. 

In putting this together, you may want to consider how Cloud adoption relates to some of the challenges that the University highlighted in their initial context and background as well as the characteristics that you identified previously. As for risks and considerations, there are a number of case studies around Cloud adoption published by Cloud Service Providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google.

Summarise your findings in two PowerPoint slides with the following headings: 

Cloud Benefits
Cloud Risks and Considerations
You may wish to use the PowerPoint template provided, or get creative and make one of your own.
