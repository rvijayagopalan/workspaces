e147c622-a22a-3cf4-a393-f453907be3cf;AAPL;Intel ‘Stunning Failure’ Heralds End of Era for U.S. Chip Sector;(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp.’s decision to consider outsourcing manufacturing heralds the end of an era in which the company, and the U.S., dominated the semiconductor industry. The move could reverberate well beyond Silicon Valley, influencing global trade and geopolitics.The Santa Clara, California-based company has been the largest chipmaker for most of the past 30 years by combining the best designs with cutting-edge factories, several of which are still based in the U.S.Most other U.S. chip companies shut or sold domestic plants years ago, and had other firms make the components, mostly in Asia. Intel held out, arguing that doing both improved each side of its operation and created better semiconductors. That strategy is in tatters now, with the company’s factories struggling to keep up with the latest 7-nanometer production process.After Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said Intel is considering outsourcing, the company’s shares slumped 16% on Friday, the most since March, when the stock market plummeted in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.“We view the roadmap missteps to be a stunning failure for a company once known for flawless execution, and could well represent the end of Intel’s computing dominance,” Chris Caso, an analyst at Raymond James, wrote in a research note on Friday.Swan says where a semiconductor is made isn’t that important. However, domestic chip production has become a national priority for China, and some U.S. politicians and national-security experts consider sending this technical knowhow overseas to be a potentially dangerous mistake.“We’ve seen how vulnerable we are,” John Cornyn, a top Senate Republican, said in June when U.S. lawmakers proposed an estimated $25 billion in funding and tax credits to strengthen domestic semiconductor production.Intel’s Xeon chips run computers and data centers that support the design of nuclear power stations, spacecraft and jets, while helping governments quickly understand intelligence and other crucial information.Many of these processors are made at facilities in Oregon, Arizona and New Mexico. If Intel outsources this work, it would likely be done by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which focuses on production and is currently the world leader. It’s based in Hsinchu, one of the closest Taiwanese cities to China, which considers the Asian island a rogue province rather than an independent country.“With the latest push out of process technology, we believe that Intel has zero-to-no chance of catching or surpassing TSMC at least for the next half decade, if not ever,” Susquehanna analyst Chris Rolland wrote in a research note. He thinks Intel should sell its plants to TSMC, although he says that’s unlikely.Over the years, Intel has spent tens of billions of dollars updating its factories, and all of Swan’s predecessors touted them as a crucial advantage that kept the company ahead of the rest of the industry. As the largest chip producer, Intel benefited from economies of scale and attracted the most experienced engineers and scientists.The rise of smartphones and other mobile devices changed all that. Intel dabbled in mobile chips, but never committed its best production and design to the area, preferring to prioritize its existing PC and server chip businesses. When smartphone sales took off, phone makers used other processors from companies like Qualcomm Inc. or they designed their own, like Apple Inc. And TSMC factories churned these components out.While Intel makes hundreds of millions of chips a year now, TSMC produces more than a billion annually. That’s given the Taiwanese company more experience to improve its factories, helping TSMC’s engineers overtake their Intel counterparts in technical execution.Read more: Intel’s Chipmaking Throne Is Challenged by Taiwanese UpstartSwan said on Friday that Intel’s products are still the best, despite the manufacturing delays. But by opening the door to outsourcing, the CEO endangers one of the last bastions of U.S. technology leadership.“By outsourcing leading edge technology, presumably to TSMC, Intel would give up what has been its main source of competitive advantage for 50 years,” Caso of Raymond James said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Sat, 25 Jul 2020 03:07:11 +0000;AAPL_2020-07-25;0.9948;0.0

323cd165-3524-3a73-a88f-3b26487d69dc;MSFT;Should We Maintain High Expectations For FAANG?;"As COVID-19 continues to hinder the economy and business throughout the country, stock market sentiment has told a very different story and showed that there is a huge disconnect right now between the economy and the markets.Throughout the pandemic, economists and analysts have tried to predict what shape of a recovery the economy will have. Everywhere from &quot;V&quot;-shaped to &quot;I&quot;-shaped to &quot;Nike Swoosh&quot; has been used to describe how the U.S. economy will bounce back from this unprecedented time. However, even with unemployment numbers climbing higher than estimated figures, and positive COVID-19 cases across the country still spiking in hotspots, the markets are in the midst of a recovery that is way ahead of the economy.The Stay-At-Home SurgeThe coronavirus pandemic has acted as a catalyst for technology and other stay-at-home product companies to prove just how important their products are in a world where all facets of life are moving online. With most of the workforce working from home for the past few months and many companies planning for a work-from-home future, technology companies have become more integral than ever before.At the forefront of those companies are the FAANG stocks: Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, all these technology giants have recently hit all-time highs, as well as other technology and stay-at-home stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Shopify Inc (NYSE: SHOP).Amazon stock is up almost 70% year-to-date. Netflix is up over 50% year-to-date, with Apple and Facebook both up over 30% as well. Not only are these mega-cap companies some of the biggest and most well-known in the world, but their products were also perfect for a global shutdown. With grocery stores shut down, people used Amazon and Shopify for e-shopping and e-retail. Working from home meant more time on the internet for Google and Facebook users, and streaming entertainment through streaming services like Netflix.Apple and Microsoft products became essential not only for personal use but also for work and communication with coworkers. The increased need for their products caused their stock prices to soar and create hope that the economy was coming back, and we were experiencing an &quot;I&quot;-shaped economy recovery because the stock market giants were doing so.Where The Economy Really IsAs of July 13, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google made up over 21% of the S&P 500 market cap. All these stocks are up over 20% year-to-date, apart from Google which is up about 14%. Compare that to the S&P 500 Index which as of close July 20th, 2020, is still down .18% year-to-date. The S&P 500 minus these five stocks is a more accurate indicator of where the broader economy really is, and mega-cap stocks have provided a distraction from how an &quot;I&quot;-shaped, or even &quot;V&quot;-shaped economic recovery just isn&#39;t there, (yet).Despite the market recovery over the last four months since the bottom in late March, it would be realistic to expect these companies&#39; growth to taper and their stock prices to potentially experience a healthy pullback as all of the above companies are trading at a historically expensive P/E ratio relative to their averages.The FAANG + Microsoft stocks have created the illusion of a speedy and complete recovery for the U.S. equity markets but unfortunately, that is not the case for the broader market. Expectations of those stocks could be lowered moving forward as other sectors catch up to the outperformance of technology.The post Should We Maintain High Expectations for FAANG? appeared first on OpenMarkets.To learn more about futures and options, go to Benzinga&#39;s futures and options education resource.See more from Benzinga  * Economic Spotlight: New Zealand And Australia&#39;s Currencies  * Options Review: H1 2020  * South Africa: Stimulus, Low Rates Face Challenges(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

7f574e78-371d-3a66-9da8-3e855bb34fb0;NFLX;Controversial Matchmaking Show Helps Netflix in Battle for India;"(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. has hit the sweet spot with a controversial reality series on a jet-setting Indian matchmaker helping her picky clients find life partners, in a boost to the streaming giant’s efforts to produce local content for subscribers in new markets.“Indian Matchmaking,” which debuted last week, touches on the centuries-old custom of arranged marriages, in which families, friends or matchmakers bring together eligibles -- unlike the popular Western reality shows like “Bachelor” or “Love is Blind.” The show features Sima Taparia -- the match arranger -- roping in astrologers, face readers and marriage coaches to accomplish her mission.The eight-episode series with its blend of romance, heartbreak and toxic relationships is gaining viewers not just in India, but also in countries like the U.S. and U.K., where there’s a significant South Asian population. The show is a major win for Netflix, which is competing for eyeballs with Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, Zee5 and SonyLIV as hundreds of millions of stuck-at-home Indians go online scouring for entertainment during the pandemic.Read more: Netflix and Amazon Score Big Wins in Battle for BollywoodNetflix has almost 193 million subscribers globally and doesn’t provide user data for individual markets. The buzz -- and some online fury -- generated by the matchmaker series illustrates that the company could start leveraging content produced for India to gain a wider audience overseas as well.“Streaming platforms have been trying to gain mind share by tailoring content with a deep connect to regional audiences,” said Tarun Pathak, a New Delhi-based associate director with Counterpoint Research. “Even if Netflix viewers don’t entirely relate to the matchmaking series, it’s still got them talking.”With China being inaccessible, India has become the battleground for the global streaming giants as they tussle for original content. Netflix recently announced 17 India originals, including Bollywood films and a romcom series, while Amazon said it’s snagged the premiere of a much-awaited Bollywood film and was also lining up multiple originals for the coming weeks.The rivals have low-cost subscription plans aimed at the country. Netflix’s mobile-only monthly plan costs 199 rupees ($2.70), while its regular plans start at 499 rupees. Amazon Prime’s all-screen subscription is cheaper at 129 rupees a month and a Disney+ Hotstar plans start at 399 rupees a year.The concept of arranged marriages -- essentially pre-vetted dating but with a more urgent and definite slant toward marriage -- has for years fascinated westerners. For many Indians, even Western-educated ones, the pressure to get married builds steadily from the mid-20s and several of the singles in the reality series say dating apps and online matchmaking hasn’t worked for them.Yet the series, while leaving some viewers wanting more, has drawn criticism for its portrayal of caste, fair-skin obsession and misogyny. Some describe it as a “cringe fest” on social media for highlighting the worst of Indian culture, including sexism and racism. But many say it holds a mirror to the ugly side of arranged marriages.Poorna Jagannathan, an actor and a series regular in Netflix’s U.S. teen comedy “Never Have I Ever,” said the show was “horrifying.”A representative for Netflix declined to comment on the content of the series or the controversy raging online.The show has also made overnight stars of its lead characters. A deluge of memes show “Sima Auntie,” the calm but judgmental matchmaker who calls the shots, as she repeatedly introduces herself as “Sima from Mumbai” and spouts lines like “ultimately my efforts are meaningless if the stars are not aligned.” As she jets between Houston, New York and Mumbai, nonchalantly peeping into bedrooms and peering into wardrobes, the matchmaker says, “In India, we don’t say ‘arranged marriage’; there’s marriage and then love marriage.”The first season ends on carefully-structured cliffhangers. Most of the singles it features do not find a marriage partner, leaving the door open for more episodes.(Updates with plans for original content in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.";Fri, 24 Jul 2020 10:08:25 +0000;NFLX_2020-07-24;0.9905;-0.2023

d165ecbe-92dc-37b0-ad30-a51c4c363e31;NFLX;Netflix Doesn’t Need Investment-Grade Ratings;"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Netflix Inc. could be a rising star in the bond market. But it shouldn’t necessarily want to be one just yet.In the parlance of credit-rating firms, investment-grade companies that are cut to junk are deemed “fallen angels.” The phrase was thrown around frequently before the coronavirus pandemic, given that hundreds of billions of dollars worth of corporate debt was one wrong step away from speculative grade. Unsurprisingly, this year’s economic crisis has tripped up household names such as Ford Motor Co., Kraft Heinz Co. and Macy’s Inc., each of which was flagged as a risk well before anyone knew the term Covid-19. S&P Global Ratings said this week that a record 126 issuers remain potential fallen angels, with 20 facing immediate downgrade pressure.A lesser-known distinction is the flip side: when a junk-rated company is lifted into the ranks of investment-grade borrowers. Known as “rising stars,” S&P anticipates the fewest such upgrades since at least 1987, when they began tracking the data. Since February, not a single U.S. company has made the leap, which is hardly surprising given the widespread damage to the U.S. economy.Which brings us to Netflix. Unlike the vast majority of businesses, stay-at-home orders and social distancing have been a boon to its bottom line. For those who missed its second-quarter results last week, the company added a whopping 10.1 million subscribers and produced $899 million in free cash flow — a figure that is normally negative, not positive. The higher-than-expected rate of subscriber growth, coupled with lower costs from a halt in the production of shows, has Netflix on track to potentially post positive free cash flow for the entire year, disproving conventional wisdom that an economic downturn would run out the clock on its debt-fueled content binge. The company’s cash position was so surprisingly strong that Bloomberg Intelligence’s Stephen Flynn and Suborna Panja suggested in a report this week that by the time Netflix taps the bond market again, it might do so as an investment-grade company. Its leverage is poised to fall further below higher-graded peers like Comcast Corp., while its business model is more resistant to the coronavirus than that of Walt Disney Co. With just $1.2 billion of debt due over the next three years, Netflix could stretch its $7 billion cash haul through 2021 until it reaches steady positive free cash flow — a clean bill of health for bond investors and credit-rating companies alike.However, it’s not clear that wowing the bond market should be Netflix’s top priority. Of course, all else being equal, having an investment-grade rating is better than not having one. But the company sold $500 million of bonds in April at a yield of 3.625%, one of the lowest rates ever in the U.S. high-yield bond market and just a handful of basis points more than the average yield on a Bloomberg Barclays index of triple-B debt. Those five-year notes traded at a paltry 2.34% this week. Clearly, Netflix has already won over Wall Street, investment grades or not.The one thing that could derail Netflix’s momentum is if it were seen as falling behind in the streaming race, rather than solidifying its spot at the front of the pack. Netflix, Disney and others with the means are in it for the long haul, for there won’t be one final winner but rather a set of companies that compete in some degree of perpetuity. This will require significant, continuing investment in new content — a finite resource because Covid-19 forced a stop to production.Netflix’s current advantage is that it has enough programming to roll out this year, which should prevent subscribers from canceling in droves of boredom. One of its latest hits was “The Old Guard,” a sci-fi action movie starring Charlize Theron, which may be one of few big films released by Hollywood this summer as theaters remain closed. A light traditional fall television season may also push more cable customers to try out streaming services. It’s time for the company to push its advantage and build its programming war chest even more, not slow down. Of course, that’s long been Netflix’s strategy: add new users and largely dismiss its cash bonfire, even as the flames shot as high as $3.3 billion in negative free cash flow in 2019. It has paid off; its shares are up about 50% this year, and it has added nearly 26 million customers in the pandemic so far. The company projects its free cash flow will dip back into negative territory next year as Hollywood gets back to work, though it mentioned that its “need for external financing is diminishing.” The fact that Netflix could stop issuing junk bonds is likely enough to keep its borrowing costs near record lows for a speculative-grade company. In April 2019, it was fair to doubt Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings when he said that “our message to debt investors is you better get in soon, because it’s not going to be that much more to go.” That’s a much more realistic scenario now, though it would be a mistake for the company to dismiss cheap financing just because it’s not burning through cash. It’s better to raise money when you can than when you need to.The peculiarities of this recession may forever change some of the most time-tested, resilient entertainment businesses. Netflix is no longer a place to watch cable reruns. It may turn to licensed content to help bridge the Covid-19 production gap, but it’s a studio in its own right. It has to be, given that its former partners have turned into direct rivals. It would be smart to stay the course, focusing on adding customers and keeping them happy so it maintains its standing as the must-have subscription — the one viewers keep while switching between other supplemental offerings. Succeed in that strategy, even if it’s costly in the short run, and the coveted “rising star” label will surely follow. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

3ad93a13-a07b-3478-913a-a539e4b8f5b5;NFLX;TikTok Ban Would Leave a Giant Social-Media Hole;"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- TikTok, the popular social-media app featuring do-it-yourself short videos, has also become one of the sore points in the growing frictions between the U.S. and China owing to its ownership by Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. In recent weeks, White House officials from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to President Donald Trump have even raised the possibility of banning or otherwise restricting TikTok, citing data-privacy and national security concerns the company denies. Does a move to outlaw TikTok make sense? So far, the government hasn’t presented any clear evidence laying out its privacy concerns about the app. And unlike Huawei Technologies Co., another targeted Chinese company whose telecommunications equipment routes critical data traffic for wireless carriers and enterprises, TikTok is used mostly by everyday Americans to share dancing, lip-syncing and funny pet videos. The two firms are worlds apart. Still, with tensions rising by the day — including the U.S. move this week to shut down the Chinese consulate in Houston and China’s vow to retaliate — it’s hard to dismiss the threat entirely as political bluster. And so it’s worth giving a thought to what’s at stake in a potential ban of TikTok, and what the consequences of shutting down such a widely used app might be.Clearly, the move would have a chilling effect on any Chinese-owned tech firms operating in the U.S. It also could trigger backlash for U.S. companies with operations in China. Most of all, it would upend the U.S. social media landscape by eliminating one of its fastest-growing platforms, and one that has carved out a unique niche.All the major platforms have different origin stories that permeate how the sites work even today. TikTok is no different. Facebook, for instance, was originally built around text-based social networking and messaging. Instagram has dominated the move toward sharing photos and images through a scrollable feed, while YouTube is the internet’s repository for longer-form videos with an interface anchored around a search engine. In contrast, TikTok’s core focus is short 15-to-60-second videos and its ability to surface the most-relevant entertaining content to each user. For many social-media influencers and celebrities, it’s not a question of choosing between platforms, but rather knowing which content to put on each. Many TikTok creators already cross-post their TikTok videos on Instagram and YouTube, but the same short-form videos get much more traction on TikTok from its better personalization algorithm for video content. A world without TikTok would mean less exposure for these stars, but not necessarily loads of new content for TikTok competitors such as Facebook Inc. or YouTube parent Google.Not that rivals are sitting still. Facebook has launched a new TikTok-like “Reels” feature in some international markets, and it’s reportedly set to appear in the U.S. Instagram app in the near future. This will pose more of a direct threat, for sure. But such bolt-on offerings may not gain as much traction as the original because they lack focus and often require extra cumbersome steps. Whatever happens, Instagram’s home page will still be centered around a scrollable feed of images. But do expect Facebook and others to keep trying. The numbers show surging demand for TikTok’s pure-play short-video platform. Sensor Tower data shows that downloads of the app have soared past its competitors over the last three quarters as more and more Americans take to TikTok as the perfect escape for turbulent times. In another milestone, Netflix added TikTok to its short list of competitors for the first time in its letter to investors last week, saying the app’s growth was “astounding.”But even more important than the numbers on users or downloads, perhaps, is the fact that TikTok users are becoming more addicted to the service. On Monday, Citi Research analyst Nicholas Jones said in a note to clients that the average TikTok user spent 476 minutes on average on the app in March, the most recent period for which data is available, resulting in the largest increase in time spent among the major platforms since October. TikTok is also now in second place overall, just behind Facebook’s 564 minutes. Instead of the major social media sites, a TikTok ban would likely benefit the smaller apps that are focused on the short-video category, including Byte App and Dubsmash. This pattern is what happened in India, where the video-focused apps such as Roposo thrived, adding millions of users in days, after the country’s ban of TikTok last month. At the end of the day, the strong demand for short-form video apps looks to be a resilient, enduring trend.TikTok also seems to be exploring ways to address the U.S.’s concerns. On Tuesday, The Information reported that ByteDance’s current American investors have started preliminary discussions with the company about buying a majority ownership in TikTok. Further, the Wall Street Journal said earlier this month ByteDance was considering the creation of a new management board, in addition to designating a new headquarters outside of China for TikTok.If an acceptable solution is found for both sides, millions of TikTok users will be able to breathe easy. Not so the other American social-media giants, until they find their own answer for the surging TikTok juggernaut, or somethng else comes along.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tae Kim is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

1a982998-491b-360a-ac04-586b3044bc86;MIST;"Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST) Hits a Couple Milestones After FDA Meeting; Top Analyst Cheers";"Tiny biopharmaceutical company Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST) had a big day Thursday, first announcing the completion of one study (NODE-301) and the continuation of a second (NODE-301B, now to be renamed the &quot;RAPID study&quot;), that will, together, support a future New Drug Application submission to the FDA for its etripamil  cardiovascular drug -- then announcing a $25 million private placement (a &quot;PIPE&quot;) to raise cash to continue its work.Milestone further advised that it has met with the FDA and agreed on &quot;an efficient path to registration for etripamil which eliminates the need to start a new Phase 3 study.&quot; Specifically, based on data from the NODE-301 study (and partially on the RAPID study as well), the FDA has agreed to modify how the RAPID study proceeds going forward. In particular, the latter study will now permit Milestone &quot;to administer an additional dose of study drug 10 minutes after the first dose if [patients] still experience signs and symptoms of a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) episode.&quot;The stock nearly tripled in value on the news -- up 167% by day&#39;s end after retreating from its highs.How significant are these two studies? In a note discussing Milestone&#39;s announcement, Cowen analyst Ritu Baral reminds that Milestone&#39;s etripamil  drug is an &quot;intranasal novel calcium channel blocker&quot; designed to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, a type of heart arrhythmia.The 5-star analyst sees the FDA&#39;s decision as a bit of a surprise -- but a good one. For one thing, she notes that the decision to allow Milestone to administer additional doses to a single patient &quot;speaks highly of the drug&#39;s safety profile from &#39;301.&quot; (Apparently, patients tolerate the drug quite well). For another, the chance that these additional doses will improve the drug&#39;s effectiveness &quot;allows for even better possible clinical efficacy from topline data.&quot; Basically, if the first 70mg etripamil dose doesn&#39;t do the trick, Milestone will be allowed to administer a second dose 10 minutes later -- giving the drug a second chance to slow the patient&#39;s heartbeat down to a normal rate and achieve a successful outcome.In the analyst&#39;s opinion, this leeway that the FDA is allowing Milestone means &quot;the RAPID trial is well set up for success&quot; when data comes out in late 2021 or early 2022, and &quot;majorly derisks the program.&quot;Financially speaking, Baral is also pleased with the PIPE. At estimated burn rates, the extra $25 million that Milestone will be raising should suffice to fund Milestone&#39;s research &quot;into 2Q22,&quot; says the analyst, and therefore &quot;past topline RAPID data.&quot; In short, it eliminates funding concerns throughout the clinical process (although additional capital raises may still take place if desirable).Mind you, none of this means that Milestone is going to become a profitable enterprise in the immediate future. While the developments are positive, Baral still expects to see Milestone lose $1.83 per share this year (albeit that&#39;s half what it lost last year), then perhaps lose $2.07 per share more next year.Regardless, the analyst is optimistic about the progress, assigns Milestone stock an &quot;outperform&quot; rating, and is doubling her price target to $12 a share. (To watch Baral&#39;s track record, click here)Overall, MIST holds a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 2 “buy” ratings and 1 “hold.” Shares are selling for $8.29, and the average price target of $13.5 implies a healthy 64% upside.

b5a4ed52-ad92-381d-9be8-56f921c1bb54;MIST;Juggling Risk And Reward In A Raucous Market;"It&#39;s been another week of solid results in a choppy market. As with last week, I&#39;m green on all five days with roughly $180,000 in gross profit. Nevertheless, there were quite a few points where I had to reclaim some lost ground after a chart just broke down.One trade that did not succumb to chop -- but easily could have -- was my biggest trade for the week. Milestone Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: MIST) was gapping up about 110% in Thursday&#39;s premarket on a news catalyst. It was trading more than 100x relative volume when I first started trading it. In total, the stock ended up netting me 40% of my total gains for the week, roughly $15,000 of which came during premarket trading.However, by the open MIST was up about 130% over its previous close and I was a little wary it was over-extended. It seemed equally likely to fall apart as take off once the bell rang, so I was cautious at the open.It ended up squeezing up more than a dollar in the first one-minute candle and, fortunately, I was ready with a large order that ended up doubling my premarket gains. I was able to tack on another $15,000 in subsequent micro-pullbacks, however, this was when the worm started to turn and MIST started losing ground and I started getting stopped out.All told I manage to walk away from my pre-market and opening trades in MIST with about $40,000. Still, the chop was very real in the minutes following the initial open, stair-stepping down to below the open before it started seeing solid positive price action.While this goes to show how quickly you may need to change gears and adapt when you trade stocks like this, it also reinforces the benefit of using stops as a tool for risk management while day trading. While I suffered some drawdown in my final few opening trades, I managed to retain the lion&#39;s share of my gains because I identified early that the stock was trading way above it&#39;s normal volume and was likely to see some drawdown as other traders took profit.All told, I ended up with $73,500 in Thursday&#39;s trades on MIST, another outstanding homerun stock. While I am still cautious about the number of false breakouts I&#39;m seeing through any given week, it&#39;s hard not to press down on the accelerator when I&#39;m also seeing stocks like MIST continue to take off.In the end, I&#39;m just going to keep balancing my fear with my greed and do my best trading the market I&#39;m in. It&#39;s done me well so far.See more from Benzinga  * When Trading Is Your Career, Consistency Is The Benchmark  * July Kicks Off With Steady Momentum  * Claim Your Independence, Learn How To Trade(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.
